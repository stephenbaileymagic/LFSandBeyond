# LFSandBeyond
My LFS Build and other projects as they come along
This repository will be for my Linux From Scratch and Beyond Linux From Scratch builds, as well as other projects as they happen.
This LFS version is 9.1 and was built on a x86 processor, specifically on an old Toshiba Laptop with an Atom processor.
It was an experiment to see if I could achieve a bootable build, making use of old hardware.
Additionally, the specs of the Atom processor are similar to a Raspberry Pi 3 in terms of speed and RAM.
I figured if it worked here, I could build on a Pi at some point.
I am posting the shell scripts which I started to use about 60% of the way through the build. Should have started earlier.
I intend to continue to develop these scripts as I build additional/new versions of LFS as an exercise in automating installation.
